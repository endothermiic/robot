# 2023 Robotics Challenge
This repository contains code for an autonomous, line-following robot. The robot is designed to follow dark lines along a track and to stop when it detects the finish line (a horizontal, solid black line). Robot movement is initilized with a bright light. 

### Parts List:
* 3.7 lipo battery
* Adafruit BH1750 ambient light sensor
* 2 IR light sensors
* 4 DC motors with wheels
* Adafruit motoshield + battery pack
* Adafruit microcontroller

This was designed to hold 4 DC motors with wheels (2 left wheels, 2 right wheels). The holes on each are used for wiring, which was attached to the underside of the robot. The protrusions around the body were made to hold a variable number of IR sensors and allow for changes to IR sensor position with testing.
